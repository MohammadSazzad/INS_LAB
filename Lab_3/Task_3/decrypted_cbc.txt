We need at least 64 bytes of text to properly demonstrate the effects.
This file will be encrypted using different modes: ECB, CBC, CFB, and OFB.
Then we will corrupt a single bit in the 30th byte and observe the decryption results.
Understanding how different encryption modes handle errors is crucial for security.
